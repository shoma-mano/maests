# A TypeScript-based solution inspired by [maestro-ts](https://github.com/johkade/maestro-ts) for writing and running Maestro flows in a modular and reusable way.

## ‚úÖ Features

- You can write Maestro flows in TypeScript and execute directly.
- Break down Flow into smaller, reusable modules
- Automatically load environment variables from .env
- Handling runScript with type.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Requirement

If you have not installed maestro yet, you have to [install](https://maestro.mobile.dev/getting-started/installing-maestro) it at first.

### Installation

```sh:
pnpm -D add maests
```

### 1: Create your first flow

Create a new file my-first-flow.ts:

```typescript
import { M } from "maests";

M.initFlow({ appId: "com.myTeam.myApp" });
M.tapOn("someTestId");
```

### 2: Execute Test

If the Android Emulator or iOS Simulator is launched, you can execute the test with:

```sh
npx maests my-first-flow.ts
```

If you don't have a project to try, the [Playground](https://maests.vercel.app/playground.html) is ready for you to use.

## üö® Trouble Shooting

Most of the issues are caused by Maestro itself rather than this library. But you can still check the YAML files that are generated by maests in the "maests" folder.
