# A TypeScript-based solution inspired by [maestro-ts](https://github.com/johkade/maestro-ts) for writing and running Maestro flows in a modular and reusable way.

## ✅ Features

- You can write Maestro flows in TypeScript and execute directly.
- Break down Flow into smaller, reusable modules
- Automatically load environment variables from .env
- Handling runScript with type.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```sh:
pnpm -D add maests
```

### Step 1: Create your first flow

Create a new file <flow-name>.ts:

```typescript
import { M } from "maests";

M.initFlow({ appId: "com.myTeam.myApp" });
M.tapOn("someTestId");
```

### Step 2: Execute Test

```sh
npx maests my-first-flow.ts
```

## 🛠️ Commands

This package offers a rich set of commands to cover various actions in your flows, including initializing flows, performing taps and presses, swiping, asserting conditions, and more.

For a detailed list of all commands with examples, refer to the [Commands Documentation](./commands.md).

## 🛹 Playground

You can try maests by simulator in [playground](playground)

```shell
# build maests
pnpm install
pnpm build
# try maests in playground
cd playground
pnpm install
npx expo run:android
npx maests e2e/sampleFlow.ts
```

## 🚨 Trouble Shooting

Most of the issues are caused by Maestro itself rather than this library. But you can still check the YAML files that are generated by maests in the "maests" folder. I'll also provide solutions for common Maestro issues later.
